Example app of how to communicate between a JS backend-frontend with Julia functions

Note: Julia and NodeJS should be installed otherwise the app will not work.
Julia: https://julialang.org/
NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/

run by cloning the repository then
$ cd the-repository-directory-path
$ cd server
$ yarn/npm install
$ node index.js

I plan to create more functionality and more complex logic later, but as of right now there is currently only the "average" function
